## An interesting Piece of code

I find it very interesting how we can chain methods to get a disired output. Is this example I am chaining the calling of three methods, the ouptup of LocalDate.Now(), becomes the input of getMonth(), the output of getMonth() becomes the input of minus(). Using it I can reduce the lines of code and it becomes more intuitive to read/write and understand. From a begginer's point of view this's very interesting!
